        <h2>Hi! I'm John Smith. I help to build websites.</h2>
        <p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
            industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
            scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
            electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
            <br>
            It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and
            more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
            <br>
            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
            looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
            letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.
        </p>
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a
            search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.
            <br>
            Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour
            and the like).
